# Web Fuzzing

**Web fuzzing is a critical technique that every penetration tester should master. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predictable inputs, 
fuzzing systematically explores the vast input space to uncover hidden vulnerabilities, often revealing weaknesses that would otherwise remain unnoticed.**

## Fuzzing vs. Brute-forcing
Fuzzing casts a wider net. It involves feeding the web application with unexpected inputs, including malformed data, invalid characters, and nonsensical combinations. The goal is to see how the application reacts to these strange inputs and uncover potential vulnerabilities in handling unexpected data. Fuzzing tools often leverage wordlists containing common patterns, mutations of existing parameters, or even random character sequences to generate a diverse set of payloads.

Brute-forcing, on the other hand, is a more targeted approach. It focuses on systematically trying out many possibilities for a specific value, such as a password or an ID number. Brute-forcing tools typically rely on predefined lists or dictionaries (like password dictionaries) to guess the correct value through trial and error.

Here's an analogy to illustrate the difference: Imagine you're trying to open a locked door. Fuzzing would be like throwing everything you can find at the door - keys, screwdrivers, even a rubber duck - to see if anything unlocks it. Brute-forcing would be like trying every combination on a key ring until you find the one that opens the door.

## FFUF

FFUF (Fuzz Faster U Fool) is a fast web fuzzer written in Go. It excels at quickly enumerating directories, files, and parameters within web
applications. Its flexibility, speed, and ease of use make it a favorite among security professionals and enthusiasts.

## wfuzz/wenum

wenum is a actively maintained fork of wfuzz, a highly versatile and powerful command-line fuzzing tool known for its flexibility and customization options. 
It's particularly well-suited for parameter fuzzing, allowing you to test a wide range of input values against web applications and uncover potential vulnerabilities in how they process those parameters.

# ffuf commands

Directory Fuzzing:

`ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http: /IP:PORT/FUZZ`

File Fuzzing:

`ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -u http: /IP:PORT/w2ksvrus/FUZZ.html -e .php,.html,.txt,.bak,.js -v`

# Recursive Fuzzing

It  starts as a normal fuzzing, but once it finds any directory it creates a sub task and starts fuzzing for that directory, untill a requirment is meet or till there are no further dir left.

## Commands 

`ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -ic -v -u http://IP:PORT/FUZZ -e .html -recursion`

`-ic` option proves invaluable. By enabling this option, ffuf intelligently ignores commented lines during fuzzing, preventing them from being treated as valid inputs.

While recursive fuzzing is a powerful technique, it can also be resource-intensive, especially on large web applications. 
Excessive requests can overwhelm the target server, potentially causing performance issues or triggering security mechanisms

To mitigate these risks, ffuf provides options for fine-tuning the recursive fuzzing process:

`-recursion-depth`: This flag allows you to set a maximum depth for recursive exploration. For example, -recursion-depth 2 limits fuzzing to two levels deep (the starting directory and its immediate subdirectories).

`-rate`: You can control the rate at which ffuf sends requests per second, preventing the server from being overloaded.

`-timeout`: This option sets the timeout for individual requests, helping to prevent the fuzzer from hanging on unresponsive targets.

Example `ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -ic -u http://IP:PORT/FUZZ -e .html -recursion -recursion-depth 2 -rate 500`

# Parameter (Get, Post, etc) and Value Fuzzing

This technique focuses on manipulating the parameters and their values within web requests to uncover vulnerabilities in how the application processes input.

Parameters are the messengers of the web, carrying vital information between your browser and the server that hosts the web application. They're like variables
in programming, holding specific values that influence how the application behaves.

## Get parameter
You'll often spot GET parameters right in the URL, following a question mark (?). Multiple parameters are strung together using ampersands (&). For example:

Code: http
`https://example.com/search?query=fuzzing&category=security`

`query` is a parameter with the value "fuzzing"

`category` is another parameter with the value "security"

`GET` parameters are like postcards â€“ their information is visible to anyone who glances at the URL. They're primarily used for actions that don't change the server's state, like searching or filtering.

## POST Parameters: Behind-the-Scenes Communication

While GET parameters are like open postcards, POST parameters are more like sealed envelopes, carrying their information discreetly within the body of the HTTP request. They are not visible directly in 
the URL, making them the preferred method for transmitting sensitive data like login credentials, personal information, or financial details.

**Encoding**: This data is encoded into a specific format, typically application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data:

**application/x-www-form-urlencoded**: This format encodes the data as key-value pairs separated by ampersands (&), similar to GET parameters but placed within the request body instead of the URL.

**multipart/form-data**: This format is used when submitting files along with other data. It divides the request body into multiple parts, each containing a specific piece of data or a file.

# Fuzzing GET request method using WENUM 

To begin, we will use `curl` to manually interact with the endpoint and gain a better understanding of its behavior

`curl http://IP:PORT/get.php`

Invalid parameter value

x: 

The response tells us that the parameter x is missing. Let's try adding a value:

`curl http://IP:PORT/get.php?x=1`

Invalid parameter value

x: 1

**wenum command** 

`wenum -w /usr/share/secLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt --hc 404 -u "http://IP:PORT/get.php?x=FUZZ"`


`-w`: Path to your wordlist.

`--hc 404`: Hides responses with the 404 status code (Not Found), since wenum by default will log every request it makes.

`http://IP:PORT/get.php?x=FUZZ`: This is the target URL. wenum will replace the parameter value FUZZ with words from the wordlist.

# Fuzzing the POST method

Our target application also features a POST parameter named "y" within the post.php script. Let's probe it with curl to see its default behavior:

`curl -d "" http://IP:PORT/post.php`

Invalid parameter value

y: 

The `-d` flag instructs curl to make a POST request with an empty body.

`ffuf -u http://IP:PORT/post.php -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" -d "y=FUZZ" -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt -mc 200 -v`

`curl -d "y=ABC" http://IP:PORT/post.php`

# Virtual Host & Sub-Domain

**Virtual hosting** enables multiple websites or domains to be served from a single server or IP address. Each vhost is associated with a unique domain name or hostname. When a client sends an HTTP request, the web server examines the Host header to determine which vhost's content to deliver. This facilitates efficient resource utilization and cost reduction, as multiple websites can share the same server infrastructure.

**Subdomains**, on the other hand, are extensions of a primary domain name, creating a hierarchical structure within the domain. They are used to organize different sections or services within a website. For example, blog.example.com and shop.example.com are subdomains of the main domain example.com. Unlike vhosts, subdomains are resolved to specific IP addresses through DNS (Domain Name System) records.

# Adding IP & Domain to /etc/hosts

`echo "IP DOMAIN" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

`tee` tell to add stuff to a file

`-a` to add the stuff at the end of a file rather than rewriting the file

# Gobuster

Gobuster is a versatile command-line tool renowned for its directory/file and DNS busting capabilities. It systematically probes target web servers or domains to uncover hidden directories, files, and subdomains

Gobuster's flexibility extends to fuzzing for various types of content:

1. Directories: Discover hidden directories on a web server.

2. Files: Identify files with specific extensions (e.g., .php, .txt, .bak).

3. Subdomains: Enumerate subdomains of a given domain.

4. Virtual Hosts (vhosts): Uncover hidden virtual hosts by manipulating the Host header.

## Gobuster VHost Fuzzing

`gobuster vhost -u http://DOMAIN:81 -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt --append-domain`


`gobuster vhost`: This flag activates Gobuster's vhost fuzzing mode, instructing it to focus on discovering virtual hosts rather than directories or files.

`-u http://DOMAIN:81`: This specifies the base URL of the target server. Gobuster will use this URL as the foundation for constructing requests with different vhost names. In this example, the target server is located at inlanefreight.htb and listens on port 81.

`-w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`: This points to the wordlist file that Gobuster will use to generate potential vhost names. The common.txt wordlist from SecLists contains a collection of commonly used vhost names and subdomains.

`--append-domain`: This crucial flag instructs Gobuster to append the base domain ( DOMAIN ) to each word in the wordlist. This ensures that the Host header in each request includes a complete domain name (e.g., admin.DOMAIN), which is essential for vhost discovery.

## Gobuster Subdomain Fuzzing

`gobuster dns -d inlanefreight.com -w /usr/share/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`


1. `gobuster dns`: Activates Gobuster's DNS fuzzing mode, directing it to focus on discovering subdomains.

2. `-d inlanefreight.com`: Specifies the target domain (e.g., inlanefreight.com) for which you want to discover subdomains.

3. `-w /usr/share/SecLists/dDiscovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt`: This points to the wordlist file that Gobuster will use to generate potential subdomain names. In this example, we're using a wordlist containing the top 5000 most common subdomains.
